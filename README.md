# flow-labeller

A little gimmick for labelling the output of flowtbag, by looking up
their lower port numbers in /etc/services, and for preprocessing the
flow file for various machine learning utilities like Weka or EFS.
More an excuse to start playing with clojure, than anything.

To compile, use leinigen.
